you hide when you cry because you want to be see as a strong person at the same time though you hate how nobody notice how break you be
please do not expect me to always be good and kind and love there be time when i will be cold and thoughtless and really hard to understand
i do not think people really understand just how stressful it be to explain what be on your mind when you do not even understand it yourself
i be scar to get close to people because i think they will eventually walk out of my life no matter how close we be because everyone leave
i think i be afraid to be happy because whenever i get too happy something bad always happen
i hate get so sad to the point where my body completely shut down and all i can do be just lay there and think about all my problems
i already know i be not good enough
sleep be so hard when you cannot stop think
i be not the same anymore i will admit it a lot of shit get to me
social anxiety suck you unintentionally make yourself sad you feel alone even when you be not and sometimes you do not even know what be wrong
i say sorry a lot because i secretly feel that everything be my fault
it suck do not it feel like you be not good enough no matter how hard you try
depression be not always sadness it can also be emptiness anger tiredness or loneliness sometimes a cry for help be not so visible
do you ever feel physically sick because you know you be not good enough for anyone and cannot do anything right no matter how hard you try
i wish someone be afraid to lose me i be always scar of lose people that i love but i doubt anyone would fight to keep me in their life

sometimes i be disappoint in myself because i know i be better than the choices i make and the things i choose to deal with
you can only be so strong for so long until you reach a point where you break physically mentally emotional
my biggest mistake ever be think that people care for me as much as i do for them but in reality it be almost always one side
i do not tweet for sympathy or attention i express my thoughts and feel this be my outlet where i can say stuff without feel judge
when i die do not go to my grave and sit there tell me how much you love and miss me those be the things i need to hear when i be alive
i truly feel like everything i say or do be always wrong like i be a total disappointment to everyone and all i ever do be let people down
i overthink a lot i be sensitive and clingy but i really do try my hardest to be good enough so i be sorry if that be not enough
do you ever just sit there and realize that you mean nothing to anyone and you start feel lose alone and unloved and truly unwanted
she pretend like nothing happen because she want people to see her strong only she know how painful emotionaly mentally she really be
be sad for no reason be worse than be sad for a reason because there be absolutely nothing you can do to make yourself feel better
i prefer to distance myself whenever i be mad because i turn into the most heartless person you will ever meet and you be go hate me for that
i be sorry for be annoy when i want to talk needy because i miss you emotional when i care and insecure because i be afraid to lose you
why be you sad i do not know no reason oh no there be plenty of reason i be just not really sure which one it be this time
do you ever feel ok but your sad at the same time you just want to talk to someone and hug them but you feel annoy so you just stay quiet
she might be laugh but deep inside she be hurt she be try to get her mind off things that make her upset by pretend to be fine
i literally notice the smallest of change in how people treat me and i overthink into think everyone hat me
you unintentionally make yourself sad you feel alone even when you be not and sometimes you do not even know what be wrong
people think you be rude or always in a bad mood
it be easier just to say i be fine when somebody ask if you be okay because sometimes it be not possible to explain why you be not
do you ever just make up scenarios in your head that you know will never happen but it make you so happy so you just keep on imagine them
oh ok actually mean my heart just get rip into a million piece but i will not tell you because you would not care how i feel anyway
i never really know where i stand in some people life one minute they treat me like i be something special then nothing the next
the worst feel be when you find out you do not mean as much to someone as you think you do and you look so stupid for care too much
every night i think about all the mistake i have make and how much i regret make those decisions because my life could have be different
the worst type of cry be at night when everyone be asleep and you have to control it with your hand over your mouth to not make a sound
sometimes it be better to keep silent than to tell others how you feel because it hurt know they can hear you but not understand you
i hate get flashbacks from things you do not want to remember it feel like your heart suddenly drop and anxiety start take you over
i be sorry i have trust issue but when you give someone everything and they toss it away like nothing something inside of you break
i need someone who will understand how unstable i be sometimes be alone can be dangerous for me but other time its exactly what i need
my only relief be to sleep when i be sleep i be not sad i be not angry i be not scar i be not hurt i be not lonely i be just nothing
i hate this feel like i be here but i be notlike someone care but they do not it be like i belong somewhere anywhere but here
have you ever want to cry but no tear come out so you just stare blankly into space while feel your heart break into a million piece
i feel myself change i do not laugh the same anymore i do not smile the same or talk the same i be just so tire and mentally exhaust
pain change people it make them trust less overthink more and shut people out
nothing hurt more then be ignore replace forget lie to
you think you be do okay and then suddenly it be a nighttime and you be alone and you be not really sure how to distract yourself anymore
all the things i do wrong 1 i rely on someone for my happiness 2 i love people more than i love myself 3 i never ask for help
we hide behind a fake smile to mask the pain but sometimes we wish someone would look closely enough and see how break we really be inside
type haha when you cannot even smile act like you be happy when all you want to do be cry tell everyone you be okay when you be not
do you ever feel the need to ask someone if they actually still want you in their life because it always feel like they do not really care
you smile but all you want be to cry you talk but you really just want to be quiet you pretend like you be happy but you really be not
that worthless feel where you should just lock yourself in a dark room because everything you do or say just seem to piss people off
she be scar to get to close to anyone anymore because everyone who promise her they would stay turn their back on her and walk away
have you ever be in one of those moods where you do not really know what be wrong but you feel really irritate with everyone and everything
i be scar to get close to people because i think they will eventually walk out of my life no matter how close we be because they always do
fghhhhjjjj
fgjj
she be hurt mentally and emotionally but everyday she walk with a smile because that be who she be the girl who never stop smile
when i be hurt i shut down i turn into a total bitch i shut off my emotions i act differently towards everything and everyone and i hate it
so many people in this world have trust issue because people say i be here for you and then run away as soon as things start to fall apart
just because her eye do not tear up do not mean her heart do not cry and just because she come off strong do not mean nothing be wrong
hate get flashbacks from things you do not want to remember it feel like your heart suddenly drop and anxiety start take over 站ou
when i cry about one thing i end up cry about everything that be mess up in my life
it really suck want to talk to someone but you really do not want to annoy anyone because they seem totally fine without you
everything be change and i do not know where i fit anymore
they say it will get better but its a lie it do not get better you just get use to it
it be painful to say goodbye to someone you do not want to let go but more painful to ask someone to stay when you know they want to leave
i hate the fact that i cry when i be angry and that be the worst thing ever because you be try to act tough and mean but instead you cry
every night i convince myself tomorrow will be different but it never be
my biggest problem be overthinking everything
you smile but you want to cry you talk but you just want to be quiet and you pretend that you be happy but you be not
i be the type of person that one thing can change my mood completely and i can go from confident to insecure in a matter of second
i be a paradox neither happy or sad i smile at pretty things amp laugh at funny things but at night i become a mess of emotions and thoughts
have you ever just randomly start cry because you have be hold in all of these emotions and pretend to be happy for way too long
it hurt so much when you can feel yourself become less and less important to the one person who truly mean the most to you
pain change people it make them trust less overthink more and shut people out
have you ever really want to ask a question but you do not because you know in your heart that you would not be able to handle the answer
you have change try go through what i have go through and then see if you be the same pain change people it make it harder to trust
physically mentally emotionally tire
its sad nobody ever know how much someone be actually hurt someone right next to you could be completely break and you would not know
you be so afraid to tell people how you feel because you fear rejection so you bury it deep inside yourself where it only destroy you more
my problem be that i start depend on people for my happiness and when they leave like they always do they take my happiness with them
how painful be it to say i be fine to the person who be the reason you be break
one minute everything be okay and the next i have no idea what be go on
the worst feel be feel unwanted by the person you need the most
it really hurt when someone be not in the mood to talk to you but when it come to someone else they act like the happiest person alive
it be scary that you never really know what someone be think or feel towards you and everything that they say could be one massive lie
all i ever want be for someone to not give up on me no matter how much i screw up and no matter how much i push them away they will stay
i be so sorry for all the people that have to deal with my constant up and down moods daily
how many time have you type i be okay while cry
it be easier just to say i be fine when somebody ask if you be okay because sometimes it be not possible to explain why you be not
i be sorry i cannot live up to your expectations i be sorry i cannot be normal like everyone else i be sorry i be not as good as everyone else
i cannot stand how quickly my mood change it effect my whole life because nobody understand me and people just get really annoy with me
do not come to my gravestone and display emotions which you never once show to me while i be breathe because that could have keep me alive
have you be so sad and tire and want to be alone but at the same time you really wish there be someone who you could talk to who care
i be the girl who pretend people word do not hurt me just so they do not know how sensitive i really be
have you ever want to cry but no tear come out so you just stare blankly into space while feel your heart break into a million piece
i do not really think people understand how stressful it be to explain what be go on in your head when you do not even understand yourself
it hurt like hell when you know that you need to let go of someone but you cannot because you be still wait for the impossible to happen
i hate get close to people these days i always regret share too much care too much do too much and feel too much
it be kind of sad when you realize the person you use to tell everything to now have no idea of what be happen with your life
i hate that feel when you be not necessarily sad but you just feel really empty
i have disappoint a lot of people this year but believe me when i say there be no one i have disappoint more than myself
my thoughts always destroy my mood
she be just break and probably cry herself to sleep almost every night although she tell you she be do fine and she be okay but she be not

you do not know pain until you be star at the mirror with tear stream down your face beg yourself to just hold on and be strong
it be sad that we can find thousands of people on twitter who understand and feel the same way we do but in everyday life we have no one
have you ever felt like you want to cry in the middle of the night without know which one of the reason it be that make you want cry
you cannot just break someone into a million piece and treat them like crap and then expect them to be okay just because you say i be sorry
i have always be afraid of lose people i love sometimes i wonder if there be anyone out there afraid to lose me
maybe i be better of alone because no one have ever love me the way i love them and i have never felt like anyone want me or need me at all
the worst type of cry be the silent one the one where you really have to hold your breath and grab your stomach just to keep quiet
she pretend like nothing happen because she want people to see how strong she be only she know how painful and emotional she really be
when i say i be okay i want someone to look me in the eye hug me tight and say i know you be not
when someone stop talk to me the way they use to i sit and stress myself think if everything else we share together be just a lie
every time i think about how stress i be i get even more stress so it be like a never end stress cycle i cannot seem to break free from
how be it possible that someone can hurt you repeatedly and you still care for them so much
you do not realize how lonely you be until it be the end of the day and you have a bunch of things to talk about but no one to tell them to

i hate lose friends just because they get into a relationship
i be do try to get your attention if you want me come find me
i text you because i want to have a conversation with you not to be piss off and get my day ruin
no girlfriend should ever feel like she be in a competition with another girl
i swear if i get another dm say do you see this pic of you its spam

ignore the ones who talk behind your back they belong behind you
girls be sensitive they overthink every little thing and they care way more than they should but that be what make their love so strong
those texts when you be just like how the fuck do i reply to this
if you will not let me be myself around you i will not let myself be around you
some people need to open their small mind instead of their big mouth
you cannot forgive somebody and then bring it up everytime you get mad
i accept your flaw but i do not accept your bullshit

i do not hate you i just lose all my respect for you
if a girl be silent it be dangerous they be either about to blow up need a hug fall apart cry inside or all of the above
when you have a good heart you help too much you trust too much you give too much you love too much amp it always seem you hurt the most
it be sad when people you know become people you know amp how you use to be able to talk to them and now you can barely look at them
the best way to avoid disappointment be to not expect anything from anyone
do not talk just act do not say just show do not promise just prove
i be sorry i get jealous sometimes amp overreact it be only because there be a bigger chance of me lose you than you lose me
part of me just want to find the right word to hurt you the same way you hurt me

the pain you feel when you realize you be not as important to someone as you think you be
i be never shock when people let me down nowadays i just hate the fact that i put myself in a position to be let down in the first place
there be a diffrence between what you say and what you do
she be a keeper too bad you do not keep her
sometimes the best thing to say be nothing some people be not even worth your word
just remember i give a fuck when no one else do
the people that be so quick to walk away be the ones that never intend to stay

i just want the pain to end
fake a smile be so much easier than explain why be you sad
your eye they use to shine so bright
do not worry about me i will be fine just do not look into my eye
i tell everybody to be strong when i be the weakest person on this world
i wonder how many people have see my cut and just never say anything
they keep say it get better but when it be not change anything for me i be worthless
the scariest part be the realisation that you have lose yourself completely sink in as you lay awake at 2 be because you lose the ability to sleep and you cannot even cry because you do not even care adh
i want to talk about it damn it i want to scream i want to yell i want to shout about it but all i could do be whisper i be fine
i be fall apart i be barely breathe with a break heart that be still beat
i do not know what i be alive or just breathe
what a shame that the girl who once believe in fairytales and magic have to be strike by reality with demons in her mind and the fear of never be love kf
some days i feel everything at once other days i feel nothing at all i do not know what be worse drown beneath the wave or die from the thirst om
nobody want me not even myself
i feel like everyone hat me and that be okay because i hate me too al

you cannot see i be hurt you do not notice the pain it feel like everyone else be sit in the sunshine while i drown in the rain

i care about all of you if you need someone to talk to my dms be open and if you just want to rant to someone i be here lot of love
i be a paradox i be neither happy nor i be sad i smile at pretty things and laugh at funny things but late at night i become a mess of emotions and thoughts and i wish i could just disappear
what do not kill you leave scar ruin your lungs dry out all you tear leaven you lie awake at 4 in the morning wish you be not alive
the saddest kind of sad be when your tear cannot even drop and you feel nothing it be like the world have just end you do not cry you do not hear you do not see you just stay there for a second the heart die anonymous
i be the type of girl who could have tear stream down my face amp still insist that everything be fine
empty lonley sad depress forget useless worthless unimportant and unloved the worst feel in the world but they be the way i feel everyday
suicide be stupid you want to know what be stupid hurt someone so much emotionally that they think suicide be the only anwer
you break me like i be one of your fuck promise
i be not a stranger to the dark hide away they say because we do not want your break part i have learn to be ashamed of all my scar run away they say no onell love you as you be this be me keala settle
you know those nights where you lay in your bed and have your hand on your mouth so you do not make a sound as tear stream down your face and you can feel your heart just break
just scar they be not just scar they be the demons i fight at 3 be they be my insecurities my deepest fear and my lonely nights they be the insult i have receive and the emotions i cannot contain they be part of me and be what i have become
i know what it be like to want to die how it hurt to smile how you try to fit in but you cannot how you hurt yourself on the outside to try to kill the thing on the inside
our brain be sick but that be okay because our grade matter more than our health anyway
no matter how much i try to make myself look do not matter i know they do and that be why i do not amount to anything because i be ugly
happy new year babes you all survive 2017 and i be very proud of you guy
i draw with silver and it turn red magic
monsters do not sleep under your bed they sleep inside of your head
dear me i hate you you be weak you deserve the pain you be imperfect you will never be good enough i hope you die
depression be not always at 3 be sometimes it hit you at 3pm when you be whit your friends and half way through a laugh and just stop
sorry mom and dad you have a suicidal kid but i promise i be go to put my best fake smile in front of you all
i only lie so i do not have to see tear of disappointment in you eye
the human skin can be hard to live in that be why most of us tear it open arg
behind my smile be a hurt heart behind my laugh i be fall apart look closely at me and you will see the girl i be be not me
have you ever want to cry but no tear come out so you just stare blankly into space while feel your heart breake into piece
if you guy really need someone to talk to i be here and i care about all of you
fake smile dry eye scratch wrists bruise thighs white pills rope tide gun load suicide
you be right to call me unstable i be a walk fuck disaster
dear mom i be sorry i could not make you any prouder of me i be sorry i do not turn out the way you want me to be i be sorry i be a disappointment to you
4 be be when i loose all control when i beg for my razor when i clench my hand in to fists to try to stop them from shake when i curl up in a ball to muffle my sob and my shake body still as i can 4 be be when i silently shatter behind close doors and try to stay alive
no one really care until something dramatic happen
everyone have scar that they do not want to talk about mine be just on my body as well as in my head
you do not have to tell me i be worthless trust me i already know
i stop talk about how i felt because i know no one care anyway
amaze how much long sleeves and a fake smile can hide
maybe that be it we eventually go numb because you cannot break a hearts that already break
you just keep go and go until you crash and cry about everything and anything at all
i kill someone you see i kill the girl who use to be me
she say she be fine but she be go insane she say she feel good but she be in a lot of pain she say it be nothing but it be really a lot she say she be okay but really she be not
you smile but you want to cry you talk but you want to be quiet you pretend that you be happy but you be not
people do not die from suicide they die from sadness anonymous
the worst feel be want to cry but have to hold it because your in public
she finally let go of her fake smile and tear slowly roll down her face as she whisper to herself i do not want to be me
my biggest fear be that eventually you will see me the way i see myself
wil could ever love the girl with scar
the loneliest moment in someone be life be when they be watch their whole world fall apart and all they can do be stare blankly
you be afraid to tell people how you feel because it will destroy them so you bury it deep inside yourself where it destroy you
i hate it when people tell me to just be happy so you think i choose to just be depress
fake friends be like shadow they follow you in the sun but leave you in the dark
most girls my age have a pretty face i just have scar
have you ever lay on your bed at night and cry because you be not good enough count all your flaw and felt worse about yourself and just felt to ugly and alone
the fault the blame the pain still there i be here alone inside of this break home break home
stop ask me to trust you when i be still cough up the water from the last time you let me drown
i never know how to handle sadness cry make me feel stupid
when cancer take a life we blame cancer depression be a disease do not blame the victim for lose the fight
let the darkness consume me
erase my existence no one will notice
i think i get better in reality it become worse than it be before
the voice in my head just will not shut up
i be fine i be just tire it be just my allergies something get into my eye i be really fine
they say to not compare yourself on social media but it be hard to not when you look the way you do and the mirror be just right there
i be so useless i should just die
there be no word for the pain of feel so unwanted
my mind be tell me to end it all
be ignore just make me feel like i should not be here
everythings a blur to me now
no motivation for anything anymore
maybe one day i will find the courage to actually do it
new year anxiety be still here
you cannot understand if you never have to experience it before
tire of be alive
i feel so alone as always
still depress
there be always no one when i need someone
at that point where no shit be give
just want to not care and move on
when you be so tire but you just cannot sleep
talk to wall
i do not belong here
star at the ceiling and wonder how i can end it all
sometimes it hurt so bad you cannot breathe
just admit it no one want me
i feel uglier and uglier everytime i see a reflection of myself
i know i be irrelevant
have you ever stand in the shower have a break down and then walk out like nothing happen
mirror mirror on the wall who be the ugliest of them all me
i hate myself so much
i feel so suffocate
isolate this be not new to me
when it be hurt so much all you can do be lie there and stare at the ceiling
just because it be not show do not mean it do not hurt
it will be okay stay strong even if you feel everything fall apart
drown
i want to disappear
2020 have be really dreadful so far
i just want to isolate
i draw and draw and draw to distract me from the pain i be feel
everytime
you will never understand the pain i felt
notokay
breathe but not live
i just want to leave but i be too break to go anywhere
they promise not to leave but they leave
nothing i do be ever good enough huh even for you
sorry for be a burden
i cannot stop the suicidal thoughts and one day they will take over
if i could say it i would but the word just cannot seem to come out
overthinking more overthinking even more overthinking no sleep
no motivation for anything

everytime i trust someone they always break that trust
emptiness just pure emptiness
you be better off without me the think of it be painful but it be the truth
everyone be better off without me
cross roads and hop some car would run me over
even someone who claim they love me ignore me be it text or facetoface that be just how irrelevant i be
apparently my presence be not need i mean i be invisible to you anyway
high expectations just lead to bigger disappointments
this world would be better off without me
invisible that be what i be to everyone
too tire to even breathe anymore
i just do not want to stay here anymore it be not like anyone would notice if i be go
i just want to burst into tear but i get to hold it back and fake a smile
they will only treasure the time they spend with you when you be go otherwise you be take for grant
i just want to disappear and never come back it be not like anyone need me anyway
i just cannot trust

new year new problems
lie down star at the ceiling for hours
i get why you do not want me i would not want me either
i be so tire of this bullshit
my thoughts be so loud
sometimes you will just let the tear flow while you stare at the empty ceiling
3am toxic thoughts
you do not need me do not lie to me
i really wish you care enough to notice that i be not okay
brain just stop think heart please stop feel

i will never be better i will never get better
insomnia my best friend
the voice they be so loud that i cannot sleep
i push everyone away it be what i do i cannot help it i just hate me
the feel of actually feel your heart break snap and shatter into a million piece only to feel numb afterwards but it be fine right as always
waste of space i want to stop exist
maybe to you i exist i stand right in front of you but to me i be not my mind be not what you see be just an empty vessel i be never there you just do not notice
everyone describe me as happygolucky if only you know but i would not want you to enter my mind you will lose just like i do
word be just word

everyone just leave you to die until they need you for their benefit
everything be go to shit

invisible to everyone
sleepless nights
tire from everything
i need to feel the pain
honestly everything point to death it will make things easier for everyone when i be not around
literally no one be ever there for me
word do not mean shit to me not anymore
you saw what i do but you never ask why and you say you care when something actually happen to me you do not even try to stop me you just watch and let it happen to me even though you know i could not stop it
you need to understand but you do not
i do not trust
i want to forget
i be invisible towards everyone
i be always the second choice
if you have bother you would have see my pain
everything be shit
i try so hard until one day i stop try
i deserve this pain it be my fault always be always will be
we be there for the people around us because we know what it feel like to feel that way and we do not want them to feel the way we do
where be everyone when i need them i have be there for everyone because i know what it feel like to be alone to have no one but no one be ever there when i need them
everyone think i be so happygolucky because i laugh and smile all the time and they think i be so strong and i can handle it but honestly i cannot i be not strong enough and i just cover it up it be alright no one need to know because they do not care
i have master smile through the pain
please take the pain away
yep not important to anyone at all just only when they need me i become their first choice
mentally amp physically exhaust
i cannot sleep i be so tire but i just cannot
lose as always
but you see no one understand
once you hurt me i will never forget
i cannot even step out of the house without panic because of anxiety
it be better i stay away do not want to be a burden to anyone
i push everyone away because i know they do not need me
i be numb to the pain
i hate when people stare
the voice in my head be get louder
the reason i smile when i be sad be to keep the wall around me from crumble
please stop pretend to care i be sick of your act
i just want to end it
sorry i exist
no one want me
i be an outcast everywhere i go even with my friends i feel leave out and all i can do be smile and pretend like i be into the conversation when really i be be ignore

i do not belong here i should not exist
i be just a toy people use and throw when they be bore with me
no one be there for me when i be there for them
why would anyone love me anyway
i be the least of your priorities i know i be worthless
it be sad how someone who you have see once or twice in school decide to take their own life and it be affect you because you know the feel of be stress out helpless and alone and you cannot do anything about it
anxiety make me breathless lol
i be tire of be ignore but it just cannot be help i be worthless
when people point out your flaw and all you can do be laugh it off and act like it be not affect you
they ignore you yet question when you be silent
no one be ever there for me but they expect me to be there for them
everyone be get tire of me so be i
why do i exist
star into space seem more interest than listen in class
scream on the inside smile on the outside
you will never understand the empty feel inside me
it be clear that i do not belong here i be just a nuisance
drown yet no one can see
look in the mirror and there be not one thing i like to see
so use to be ignore but it be so painful everytime it make me feel like i be not worth the time whichi guess i be not
i tend to push everyone out of my life
i feel so alone in a city full of people
that empty feel in me stay
the year of be alone
i be use to it
i do not feel the need to open up to anyone anymore
fall apart
even tear cannot fall now i feel nothing i feel like nothing i be useless
my wall just keep get higher and higher block everyone out
i be so tire of every single thing
that empty feel i cannot get rid of
i be at that point where i do not need anyone or rather no one need me
i be a burden
i cannot do this any longer
i do not belong here no one disagree
everyone be just too busy for me i guess i be not worth their time
walk on the road not bother to look leave or right anymore
they pretend to understand you
fire be beautiful from far however like me come any closer and you will get hurt
no one would notice if i disappear
it be so painful to be alive
do not worry i be just tire
everyone leave you alone and wonder why you push them away really
i be not lazy i be just too scar to even breathe
ever felt so alone you might as well just die
school be start and my anxiety be at it be peak
happy new year another year we have survive
i have anxiety about almost everything
relatable
i do not want to feel anything
it hurt so bad
insomnia take over
everyone be too busy for me i guess i be not important as always
no one want me here i do not belong i be worthless
one blade a day keep the thoughts away
i be slowly lose it
it be so loud in my head
it hurt so bad but all i can do be lie there and do nothing
sometimes i do not even know what to feel anymore it be just blank
slowly push everyone away
you do not know when i fake it
sleep be my only escape but how do i sleep when the thoughts be keep me awake
when i be alone in a room so silent the demons inside me come out to play
people change do not expect them to be the same person you know years before
i feel so dead on the outside and inside
i be not important to anyone i be nothing
dear diary i do not want to live anymore
overthinking
i care too much before now i do not
everyone do the same it be just all talk no action until something happen
mentally and physically drain
music have always be there for me when no one have
sick of everything and everyone
i may look perfectly normal on the outside but my mind be fill with thoughts that destroy me from the inside
you help them when they need you but when you need them where be they
do not miss me when i be go because you never do when i be not
the way i be feel right now i might as well just be dead
i be so tire but i just cannot sleep
most things be easier say than do
i feel so suffocate at home and yet it be where i feel the safest
we all die alone anyway
i look at everyone around me and constantly compare myself to them i lose everytime
if you think for a second that they carethey do not
constant thoughts of die
i have to feel the pain to feel alive
it hurt so bad and yet i have to keep a smile on to prevent more question ask
cry silently and no one notice a thing
the pain i feel keep me alive
not look both ways anymore when i cross the road
i be not a priority since the begin
just push everyone away because they will eventually leave you anyway
you think i be okay but i be not
sit alone let the thoughts flow through my head like an endless stream
leave me alone if you have nothing nice to say
eternal sleep
everything change and happiness will not last
what be the point of do it if no one appreciate it
everyone start care when it be too late
everything be a mess
the more i go on the less i care
i can tell when you be lie straight to my face
just fake a smile and they will think that you be fine
nothing be how i be to everyone
how no one ever listen to you eventually make you feel alone and suicidal
my opinions do not even matter to anyone anymore i be always invincible
i do not need you to point out my flaw for me i see them myself
look in the mirror all i see be my imperfections
constant thoughts of suicide
when they tell you to sleep but it be not like you do not want to you just cannot
even before i eat i feel fat
cannot be perfect will never be perfect
if i be to disappear i will not waste anyones time money and space
just fake a smile that be all i need to do to fool you
i need to disconnect from reality
everyone hat me i know i hate me too
emotionally drain
nobody truly care until you make a mistake
you do not have to indirectly tell me that i be fat i know i be
insomnia over think numb
everyone who enter my life leave anyway
it be dangerous in my mind
the word replay in my head puncture my heart
look in the mirror i see something i hate the most my face
they think if i look happy i be fine
that pain in your chest in which you feel emotionally and physically
if i be not hurt myself i end up hurt those around me
as ugly as always
they be so use to you that they think nothing be wrong anymore you be just an attention seeker to them
you will not understand the pain unless you have felt it
everyone act like they care but they do not
that unexplainable feel of be alone and feel like i do not belong
this be what be happen
maybe everyone be lifes would be better if i just disappear
suicidal thoughts everyday
it be true that people only care if you be pretty or die
they tell you suicide be not the only option but make it seem like it be
people who look happy be often the saddest
i just cannot control it
they say that they care but do they really do not think so
mentally and physically exhaust
i be wear a mask everyday and yet you cannot see it
experience pain so much put on a smile be nothing
be you okay you must not know what be go on in my mind
do not pretend to know me when you do not
they say that they care but in the end it be all for show
i may smile but it hurt so much worse of all you will not even know
i sleep to escape from reality and all the thoughts that haunt me it be not because i be lazy
i try but as always i fail
useless worthless depress
they ignore you when you be not important but when you be they act like they have know you forever
i may act normal on the outside but i be scream inside
you look happy well look closer
you be the one who cause me to build my wall up do not blame me for not let you in
i want to escape from reality
i just want to sleep forever and never wake up
social anxiety kick in anytime anywhere suddenly
i open up to you instead you think i be fake and seek attention
you do not know how it feel like until you have experience it
the word they think do not hurt be like a stab to my heart
no expectations no disappointments
hide it from you be easy you will never notice it anyway
everyone be take blame on me what be new
people who truly care for you will make time for you even with their busy schedule
there be always a yin in the yang the bad in the good
depression have a way of come back to you even if you surround yourself with positivity
have you ever felt like your heart be literally break into piece uncountable
heart break that lead to heart pain
people never come to you when you need them they only come to you when they need you
i guess it do not matter to anyone
the demons haunt me day and night
parent always complain about how i sleep too much if only they know that it be my only escape from the demons that haunt me
do not know what be go on in someone be head do not stab them with word
fall asleep fall apart
walk out and feel like everyone be star and judge you
you cannot fix a break soul
ever felt like your heart be pound so fast you cannot breathe or walk and everything be blur social anxiety
no one care until you try to kill yourself then they pretend like they really care but they just do not want to look bad
nobody no one alone
the sadder we be the happier we smile
i never exist in anyones eye as someone special
you will not know how it feel until it happen to you
people will eventually leave me
the word they have say replay in my mind every night
i take word to heart even if you do not really mean it
hurtful word that you do not even mean may lead to depression for someone else
it always feel like all eye be on me and i cannot breathe or walk
ever felt like no one care enough
those thoughts that make me consider if i should go on
drown you think you be breathe in air but really you be just die inside
brokened ring shatter dream
so many things go through my mind
break down in the middle of the night
they throw you away when they be do use you
ever felt like you be alone always
the word felt like a stab in the heart
break to piece
loud music to cover the thoughts from enter my mind
another day of fake happiness and smile
it be back
suffer
leave alone nothings new
i doubt anyone would notice if i be miss or dead
cannot remember the last time i be happy it be all fake
in a city full of people and yet i feel so alone
laugh do not mean i be happy it just mean i be hide the pain i feel inside
numb from the pain
coldness
shut the world off
lock myself in depress
so cold it be freeze
everyone be tire of me
corner into the darkness
leave all alone
little do i know you do not care
you cannot break someone who be already break
painless death
just watch time go by like a blur
no one care huh guess i should have expect that
a stab pain in my heart and i feel so empty
little do you know it be get worse
i wish i do not exist i bet you do too
lonely and cold nothings new
treasure me when you need me and throw me when you do not need me
no one care anyway
look up to stop the tear from pour down
midnight overthinking
sudden sadness
you be just say it out of pity
do you truly understand me i doubt it
to go and never come back
blur lose cold
lose souls empty mind
hurt inside laugh on the outside
brokened
i be a failure
no one care about me now so why will they when i be dead
i be nowhere close to perfect
i be never good enough
people only come to you when they need you and abandon you when you need them the most
it be beyond my control
i should not exist
do i even belong here
depress
lonely within the city full of people
you break me do not expect me to stay the same
i be what you call the live dead
stick in life
i doubt anyone would notice if i be dead
do you think it will really affect me yes it will
you will see who really care for you in your time of need
you cannot fix someone who break so long ago
accidental cut they do not hurt more than word
the numbness consume me
everyone hat me
life be not on my side
i laugh it off as if the word do not hurt but it do painfully
suicidal thoughts keep come
look into my eye and tell me that i be fine but i be not
it be get tire
i just want to avoid everyone
they just want to see you fall
no motivation no nothing
fake smile that be the only thing i be really good at
no one be with me
stay strong they say but they do not even care
help others but not myself
it be okay i would not choose me either
i need someone to stay by my side but everyone seem to leave
